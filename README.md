# LEGIX: Unnecessary evil HTTP Client

## Why

Most HTTP client applications have been lobotmized by requiring user accounts, payment plans, and have closed their source code — all for tasks that, at their core, often boil down to storing JSON data and running a simple fetch request.
As a reaction to this trend, I decided to build my own HTTP client as a form of protest against an issue many developers are tired of. Some examples of such clients include Postman, Insomnia, Thunder Client, etc.

## Clarification

My intention is not to diminish the work or effort that the developers of these applications have put into them. They are likely just following product requirements.
However, I believe the direction these tools are taking is not ideal for the developer community.

## Basis

The goal is for the application to be available as a desktop app, a CLI tool, and a VS Code extension.
